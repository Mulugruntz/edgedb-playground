# edgedb-playground
Playground with EdgeDB + Docker

## Problem
A table creation that was committed seems to have disappeared after another table creation.


## How to reproduce:

### Prerequisites
* docker (installed: `Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea
`)
* docker-compose (installed: `docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 8d51620a
`)

### Steps
```
git clone https://github.com/Mulugruntz/edgedb-playground.git
cd edgedb-playground
docker-compose up --build
```

## What is happening
* A connection is opened
* For each of the following, we open a new transaction with the same connection.
    * Table A gets created
    * Check: table A exists
    * Table B gets created
    * Check: table B exists
    * Check: table A does not exist anymore???
